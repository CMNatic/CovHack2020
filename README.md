# CovHack2020
My Submission for Coventry Hackathon 2020 (My first ever!)


## Basis:
The basis of the app is a community-driven website, where residents of communities can plot and monitor local crime for potential hotspots etc.

## It is very hack-a-thon-y aka: you'll be lucky if you get any mileage let alone it vary.


I might come back to this and develop it further, but to be honest it was just nice to attend a hackathon and play around with Google API's!


So long and thanks for all the fish!
